README for AMATOSMEditor
=================================

* To set the URL of the AMAT OSM Server go to "Edit / Preferences"
than to the last but one page from the bottom of the dialog
and set the URL into the text box like this:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/osm/api
    
without any trailing slashes.

* To use the plugin, load any OSM data from any source (ie: OSM server, from disk, using Tasking Manager, etc.)

* To load data from the AMAT OSM Server use action:
    "Data / AMAT Download (CTRL + SHIFT + D)"
It's important to use the action again whenever new OSM data are loaded (or new bounds are added).
Note that the "AMAT" layer created in JOSM it is NOT editable.

*  Select a Way in any OSM layer and move its first and last Nodes roughly upon the two matching AMAT Nodes,
than select only the Way itself

* To see a comparison dialog of data from the OSM Way and the matched AMAT Way, use action:
    "Data / AMAT Compare Ways (CTRL + SHIFT + Q)"

* To copy data into the OSM Way from the matched AMAT Way, use action:
    "Data / AMAT Copy Way (CTRL + SHIFT + A)"

* If the OSM Way is longer than any near AMAT Way, you must split it up using action:
    "Tools / Split Way (P)"
    
* If the geometry of the OSM Way is inverted, you must split it up using action:
    "Tools / Reverse Ways (R)"
    
* If the "AMAT Copy Way" action find conflicting tags between OSM and AMAT Ways, it shows a comparison dialog
where you can decide what to do:
    All => copy both geometry and tags
    Geom => copy geometry only
    Tags => copy tags only
    Cancel => do not copy anything
