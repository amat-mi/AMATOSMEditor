README for AMATOSMEditor
=================================

* A prebuilt plugin file "AMATOSMEditor.jar" is included in this repository,
but if you prefer to build the plugin yourself, follow instructions here:
    http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/DevelopersGuide/DevelopingPlugins
    
Note that in order for the build to work you must checkout the JOSM core and its plugins 
in the same directory tree, so that the structure is like this:
    josm
        /core
            <here goes the JOSM source code>
        /dist
        /i18n
        /nsis
        /plugins
  
You must checkout all JOSM plugins like this:
    svn co http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/editors/josm josm
	       
And you must checkout the JOSM code into the "josm/core" directory!!!

Also, since this plugin is not hosted in a SVN repository, you must modify the common build script,
or the build won't succeed!!!
Open file "josm/plugins/build-common.xml", and change it like this:
    <!-- PAOLO 14/02/2014 - Remove use of version from SVN or GIT and make them fixed 
    <target name="dist" depends="compile,revision"> -->
    <target name="dist" depends="compile">

Note that this is just a dirty hack!!!
	        	
* To manually install the plugin, copy the compiled plugin file "AMATOSMEditor.jar"
from "josm/dist/" to "~/.josm/plugins/" (to "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\JOSM\plugins" for Windows).
 
* To activate the plugin, go to "Edit / Preferences"
than to the "Configure available plugins" page (the fourth one from the top)
and activate the "AMATOSMEditor" plugin.
 
* Configure the plugin by going to "Edit / Preferences"
than to the "Settings for the AMATOSMEditor plugin." page (the last but one from the bottom).
Set the URL of the AMAT OSM Server into the text box like this:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/osm/api

without any trailing slashes.

Set the actual text to be used for the "loc_ref" tag into the text box like one of these:
    loc_ref
    loc_ref:cycleway

If left blank, literal "loc_ref" will be used.

* To use the plugin, load any OSM data from any source (ie: OSM server, from disk, using Tasking Manager, etc.)

* To load data from the AMAT OSM Server use action:
    "Data / AMAT Download (CTRL + SHIFT + D)"
It's important to use the action again whenever new OSM data are loaded (or new bounds are added).
Note that the "AMAT" layer created in JOSM it is NOT editable.

*  Select a Way in any OSM layer and move its first and last Nodes roughly upon the two matching AMAT Nodes,
than select only the Way itself

* To see a comparison dialog of data from the OSM Way and the matched AMAT Way, use action:
    "Data / AMAT Compare Ways (CTRL + SHIFT + Q)"

* To copy data into the OSM Way from the matched AMAT Way, use action:
    "Data / AMAT Copy Way (CTRL + SHIFT + A)"

* If the OSM Way is longer than any near AMAT Way, you must split it up using action:
    "Tools / Split Way (P)"
    
* If the geometry of the OSM Way is inverted, you must split it up using action:
    "Tools / Reverse Ways (R)"
    
* If the "AMAT Copy Way" action find conflicting tags between OSM and AMAT Ways, it shows a comparison dialog
where you can decide what to do:
    All =>         copy geometry and all tags
    Geom+LocRef => copy geometry and tag "loc_ref"
    Geom =>        copy geometry only
    LocRef =>      copy tag "loc_ref" only
    Tags =>        copy all tags
    Cancel =>      do not copy anything

Note that the actual text used for the "loc_ref" tag is the one set inside the Preferences dialog.
